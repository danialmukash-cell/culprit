# Demo script (≤ 5 minutes)

Format: screen recording of the dashboard with voiceover. Record at 1440×900 or larger, dark theme.
Speed up the middle of the bisection (2×) if the model is slow; never cut the approval moment.

**Before recording**

Record the real model (`CULPRIT_MODEL_PROVIDER=bedrock`). If you want the strongest possible video,
record the *unseen* scenario instead of (or after) the churn one: `culprit demo init-secondary` and
paste `demo/fraud-risk` into the dashboard — then nothing on screen is something our own fixture
could have replayed. Adjust the numbers in the narration to what you actually see.

```bash
culprit demo init --force                 # fresh repo: 'five PRs merged yesterday', bad nightly this morning
culprit serve --open                      # dashboard at http://127.0.0.1:8000
# in the sidebar: "Use demo repo"; leave the metric empty (f1 from .culprit.yaml)
# extra instructions: "Five PRs merged yesterday; the nightly F1 dropped."
```

Have a second browser tab open with `demo/churn-model` in your git viewer (or a terminal with
`git log --oneline`), and the `.culprit.yaml` file visible.

## 0:00 — Hook (15–20 s)

*Screen: a terminal running `scripts/nightly.sh` (the nightly job records the bad metric and the
watcher starts Culprit by itself), then the dashboard picking up the running investigation. If you
prefer to start from the dashboard, click Investigate instead — the rest of the script is unchanged.*

> "This is a real ML repo. Every test is green. But last night its nightly F1 fell from 0.83 to 0.66,
> and five pull requests merged yesterday. Somewhere in there is the one that broke the model.
> Culprit doesn't guess which one. It reruns the experiments and proves it."

## 0:20 — Problem (30 s)

> "Every ML team knows this ritual: find the last good run, check out commits one by one, retrain,
> compare, read diffs, write a fix, prove it, write the post-mortem. It's repetitive, urgent, and it
> eats a senior engineer's day. Monitoring tools tell you *that* something regressed. Nobody does the
> *investigation* — because the investigation means running experiments and touching code."

## 0:50 — User (15 s)

> "Culprit is for ML engineers and applied scientists who own a model in CI. If you have a git repo,
> a training command, and a metric history, you drop in one YAML file and Culprit can investigate
> your repo."

*Show `.culprit.yaml` briefly: metric, experiment_command, test_command.*

## 1:05 — Live workflow (2 min 15 s)

*Screen: the timeline and bisection board updating live.*

> "I click Investigate. Culprit reads the metric history and finds the window: last good commit,
> first bad commit. It lists the five candidates."

> "Now watch the bisection board. It calibrates first — it runs the smoke experiment on the known-good
> and known-bad commits so it knows what 'good' and 'bad' look like under the fast config. Then it
> bisects: middle commit — bad. Next — good. Two calibration runs and two bisection steps later, it has
> isolated the culprit:
> a refactor called 'simplify categorical encoding with pandas.factorize'."

*(If needed, 2× speed here.)*

> "It reads the diff and explains the mechanism: factorize assigns integer codes by order of first
> appearance — per dataframe — so training and evaluation got different encodings. Nothing crashed.
> The model just quietly got worse."

> "Then it does the work: it creates a fix branch, restores stable category codes, and — this is the
> part I care about — it *re-runs the experiment on the fix branch*. F1 is back to 0.81. It writes a
> regression test that would have caught this, and runs the test suite. Green."

*Pause on the approval card.*

> "And now it stops. This is the only question it asks me: open the pull request? I can read the
> root cause, the evidence table, the fix. I click Approve."

*Click Approve. Show PR + Slack notification + incident report appearing.*

> "The PR is opened, the team channel is notified, and I get a structured incident report — culprit,
> evidence, fix, guard test, follow-ups."

## 3:20 — What Strands is doing (40 s)

*Screen: `investigator.py` and `approval.py` side by side, or the architecture diagram.*

> "Under the hood this is one Strands agent with twelve tools. The loop you just watched — observe,
> reason, run an experiment, inspect, repeat — is the model's own; the tools only return data.
> The approval is a Strands **interrupt** raised from a `BeforeToolCall` hook: the agent loop stops,
> the session is persisted with `FileSessionManager`, and I can approve from the web UI, the CLI, or
> another AgentCore invocation — even hours later, in a different process. A budget hook caps
> experiments, a trace hook feeds this timeline, and the final report is Pydantic structured output."

## 4:00 — Architecture (25 s)

*Screen: `docs/diagrams/architecture.png` (or `investigation-sequence.png` if you want to walk the interrupt).*

> "Three front doors — CLI, dashboard, and an Amazon Bedrock AgentCore Runtime entrypoint — share one
> RunManager and one agent. Adapters for the metric store, GitHub and Slack have local fallbacks, so
> the whole workflow runs without credentials, and the test suite drives the exact same agent loop
> with a deterministic offline model."

## 4:25 — Result / impact (20 s)

> "Before: hours of a senior engineer's morning, and a post-mortem nobody writes. After: one
> investigation you can watch, a fix that is measured rather than asserted, a guard test, and one
> click. The metric history and the repo are real, and there is a second repository with a different
> bug that our own test fixture cannot solve — `culprit evaluate` scores the real model on it and
> writes the numbers to evaluation.json."

## 4:45 — Closing line (10 s)

> "Culprit: when your model gets worse overnight, it finds the culprit, proves it, fixes it — and
> asks you once. Built with Strands Agents, ready for AgentCore."

### Fallbacks while recording

* Bedrock is slow or throttled → set `CULPRIT_MODEL_PROVIDER=scripted` (deterministic, well under a
  minute) and say on camera that this is the offline integration-test policy replaying the churn
  scenario, not the model. Never present a scripted run as a model run.
* The model picks a different (valid) fix → that's fine; the verification experiment is the proof.
* Model writes a failing guard test → let it iterate once on camera ("it noticed and fixed the test");
  if it loops, cut and restart from `culprit demo init --force`.
* Approval accidentally rejected → `culprit resume <id> --approve` from a terminal — a nice moment
  to show cross-process resume.
